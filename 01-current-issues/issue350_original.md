# Issue #350: Upgrade neware readers and refactor how text readers work

Source: https://github.com/jepegit/cellpy/issues/350

## Original issue text

Local neware files will now be available and cellpy must be able to parse and load them.

We expect continous improvement of different text-based readers, so it makes sense to take another look on how they are implemented, especially the model keyword.

Neware also provides other file formats (and maybe also access to its db) - we should start to look at that as well.
