abstract = {Battery evaluation and early prediction software package (BEEP) provides an open-source Python-based framework for the management and processing of high-throughput battery cycling data-streams. BEEPs features include file-system based organization of raw cycling data and metadata received from cell testing equipment, validation protocols that ensure the integrity of such data, parsing and structuring of data into Python-objects ready for analytics, featurization of structured cycling data to serve as input for machine-learning, and end-to-end examples that use processed data for anomaly detection and featurized data to train early-prediction models for cycle life. BEEP is developed in response to the software and expertise gap between cell-level battery testing and data-driven battery development.}
