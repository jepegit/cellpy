# Best practices for cellpy

This project is called "cellpy". 
It is supposed to work an many platforms.

We have several python environments

conda: cellpy_dev_321
python: .venv

Rember to activate it! 

We also have uv installed. Use it if you want (uv run python).


## Working on issues

### Setting up

We have a slash command available for setting things up when starting working on an issue: /create-original-issue-file

### When working

After each iteration, update the documents in `01-current-issues` (should contain one file labelled `_original` that consists of the original issue description, and supplementary status files describing what has been done, current status, and remaining work).
Use an explicit status checkbox in the status file:
- `- [x] Done` when fully resolved
- `- [ ] Done` when not fully resolved

### When finishing an issue

If the issue is fully resolved (no additional subtasks present), move the original and status markdown files to `03-solved-issues`. Else, move them to `02-partly-solved-issues`.
