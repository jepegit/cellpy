# My `cellpy` notes

Use this to write down notes and follow the progress of the project.
This will be particularly useful for updating the HISTORY.rst file before
releases.

## Unspecified

### Need to use API token for PyPI
First, generate an API token for your account or project at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/

Then, use this token when publishing instead of your username and password.

See https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken for help using API tokens to publish.

### CI - Appveyor vs GitHub actions
- 2022-07-30 Tried to use GitHub actions for windows tests - failed most likely due to missing AccessDatabaseEngine.
- 2022-07-30 Changed from pip to conda install (dev_environment.yml) in Appveyor - fixed failed run!
