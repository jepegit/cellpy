# My `cellpy` notes

Use this to write down notes and follow the progress of the project.
This will be particularly useful for updating the HISTORY.rst file before
releases.

## Unspecified

### CI - Appveyor vs GitHub actions
- 2022-07-30 Tried to use GitHub actions for windows tests - failed most likely due to missing AccessDatabaseEngine.
- 2022-07-30 Changed from pip to conda install (dev_environment.yml) in Appveyor - fixed failed run!

Step 1: replace all occurrences of cells[0] with .data property
    - cellreader: need to fix merge
        - removed it for now (used in dev_update... but that must be changed anyway)
    - cellreader: need to fix from_raw
        - done with still some clean up left
        - add uid / hash?
    - cellreader: remove dataset_number as an argument
        - done
    - cellreader: remove for-loops for cells in all methods (summary, xxx)
        - done
    - cellreader: replace list with data object for load and save cellpy-files
        - done
    - modify .data property so that it sets and gets the data object directly to self._cell
        - done
    - instruments: work on single data instead of cells (list) - replace both in from_raw and the individual instrument loaders
        - done

Step 2: rename the Cell object to Data
    - done

Step 3: rename the .data property to .data
    - rename in cellpy
        - done
    - rename in notebooks TODO

Step 4: rename CellpyCell to CellpyCell
    - rename in cellpy
        - done
    - rename in notebooks TODO

Step 5: rewrite merging / appending TODO
    - done
