Installation
============
``cellpy`` is available on Windows and Linux and can be installed using ``pip`` or ``conda``, or can be installed from source.


Windows
==============

Conda
-----

Usually, the easiest way to install ``cellpy`` is by using conda:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install cellpy


This will also install all of the critical dependencies, as well as ``jupyter``
that comes in handy when working with ``cellpy``.

You can install pre-releases by adding the ``--pre`` flag.


Pip
---

If you would like to install only ``cellpy``, you should install using pip.
Note that ``cellpy`` uses several packages that are a bit cumbersome to install
on windows (e.g. ``scipy``, ``numpy`` and ``pytables`` ).

Install ``cellpy`` by running this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install cellpy


You can install pre-releases by adding the ``--pre`` flag.
