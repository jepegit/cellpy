1. Simple usage as a python library
===================================

To use ``cellpy``, start with importing it::

    >>> import cellpy

Let us define some variables::

    >>> file_name = r"C:\data\20141030_CELL_6_cc_01.res"
    >>> mass = 0.982 # mass of active material in mg
    >>> out_folder = r"C:\processed_data"

Then load the data into the data-class (this is data obtained using an Arbin battery tester,
for the moment we assume that you are using the default settings where the default
data-format is the Arbin .res format)::

    >>> c = cellpy.get(file_name, mass=mass)

Here we are choosing to go for the default options, and cellpy will load the file (using the file-loader "arbin_res" since
the filename extension is .res), create a summary (for each cycle) and generate a step table (parsing the
data and finding out what each step in each cycle is).


You can now save your data as a tester agnostic cellpy-file (uses hdf5 file format, and will
include your summary and step table)::

   >>> c.save("cellpyfiles/20141030_CELL_6_cc_0.h5")

You can also save your data in csv-format easily by::

    >>> c.to_csv(out_folder)

Or maybe you want to take a closer look at the capacities for
the different cycles? No problem. Now you are set to extract data
for specific cycles and steps::

    >>> list_of_cycles = c.get_cycle_numbers()
    >>> number_of_cycles = len(list_of_cycles)
    >>> print(f"you have {number_of_cycles} cycles")
    you have 658 cycles
    >>> current_voltage_df = c.get_cap(5) # current and voltage for cycle 5 (as pandas.DataFrame)

You can also look for open circuit voltage steps::

    >>> cycle = 44
    >>> time_voltage_df1 = c.get_ocv(ocv_type='ocvrlx_up', cycle_number=cycle)
    >>> time_voltage_df2 = c.get_ocv(ocv_type='ocvrlx_down', cycle_number=cycle)

There are many more methods available, including methods
for selecting steps and cycles (``get_current``, ``get_voltage``, *etc.*)
or tuning the data (*e.g.* ``split`` and ``merge``).

Take a look at the index page (:doc:`modules <source/modules>`), some of
the tutorials (:doc:`tutorials <basics>`) or notebook examples (:doc:`Example notebooks <notebooks>`).


2. Convenience methods and tools
================================

The ``cellpy.get`` method interprets the file-type from the file extension and automatically creates
the step table as well as the summary table::

    >>> import cellpy
    >>> c = cellpy.get(r"C:\data\20141030_CELL_6_cc_01.res", mass=0.982)
    >>> # or load the cellpy-file:
    >>> # cellpy.get("cellpyfiles/20141030_CELL_6_cc_0.h5")


If you provide the raw-file name and the cellpy-file name
as input, ``cellpy.get`` only loads the raw-file if the cellpy-file is older than the
raw-file::

    >>> c = cellpy.get(raw_file_name, cellpyfile=cellpy_file_name)

Also, if your cell test consists of several raw files, you can provide a list of filenames::

    >>> raw_files = [rawfile_01, rawfile_02]
    >>> c.get(raw_files, cellpy_file)

``cellpy`` will merge the two files for you and shift the running numbers (such as data-point) into
one "continuous" file.

``cellpy`` contains a logger (the logs are saved in the cellpy logging
directory as defined in the config file). You can set the log level
(to the screen) by::

    >>> from cellpy import log
    >>> log.setup_logging(default_level="DEBUG")

If you would like to use more sophisticated methods (*e.g.* database readers),
take a look at the tutorial (if it exists), check the source code, or simply
send an e-mail to one of the authors.
