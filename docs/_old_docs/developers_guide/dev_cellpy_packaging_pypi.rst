Create package for PyPI
=======================

Build package

Upload package

The ``cellpy`` package on PyPI requires 2-factor identification. For this to work, you need to create a token.
See below for instructions on how to do this.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m twine upload dist/* -u __token__ -p pypi-<token>"


.. Note::

    The following instructions are copied from the PyPI website (https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).
    Please see the PyPI website for the latest instructions.

    Get the API token:
        - Verify your email address (check your account settings).
        - In your account settings, go to the API tokens section and select "Add API token"

    To use an API token:
        - Set your username to "__token__"
        - Set your password to the token value, including the pypi- prefix
