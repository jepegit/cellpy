Create ``conda`` package
========================

This is a short description on how to update the conda-forge recipe for ``cellpy``:

- Fork
    If not already done, make a fork of https://github.com/conda-forge/cellpy-feedstock

- Clone
    If not already done, clone the repo (your-name/cellpy-feedstock)

    >>> git clone https://github.com/your-name/cellpy-feedstok.git
    >>> git remote add upstream https://github.com/conda-forge/cellpy-feedstock

- Get recent changes
    >>> git fetch upstream
    >>> git rebase upstream/main

    This can also be done (I think) via the web interface by navigating to
    your fork and clicking the button "Sync fork".

- Make a new branch in your local clone
    >>> git checkout -b update_x_x_x

- Edit
    - hash (`pypi` - `release history` - `Download files`)
    - version (use normalized format *e.g.* ``0.5.2a3`` not ``0.5.2.a3``!)
    - build number (should be 0 for new versions)

- Add and commit
    e.g. "updated feedstock to version 1.0.1"

- Push
    >>> git push origin <branch-name>

- Re-render if needed (different requirements, platforms, issues)
    >>> conda install -c conda-forge conda-smithy
    >>> conda smithy rerender -c auto

    This can also be done (I think) via adding a special
    comment during the pull request/merging on github.

- Create a pull request via the web interface by navigating to
  https://github.com/your-name/cellpy-feedstok.git with your web browser
  and clicking the button create pull request.
- Wait until the automatic checks have complete (takes several minutes)
- Merge pull request (big green button)
- Drink a cup of coffee or walk the dog

- Check if the new version is there:
    >>> conda search -f cellpy

- Now you can delete the branch (if you want)
