Working with the ``pandas.DataFrame`` objects directly
======================================================

.. note:: This chapter would benefit from some more love and care. Any help
    on that would be highly appreciated.

The ``CellpyCell`` object stores the data in several ``pandas.DataFrame`` objects.
The easies way to get to the DataFrames is by the following procedure:

.. code-block:: python

    # Assumed name of the CellpyCell object: c

    # get the 'test':
    data = c.data
    # data is now a cellpy Data object (cellpy.readers.cellreader.Data)

    # pandas.DataFrame with data vs cycle number (coulombic efficiency, charge-capacity etc.):
    summary_data = data.summary
    # you could also get the summary data by:
    summary_data = c.data.summary

    # pandas.DataFrame with the raw data:
    raw_data = data.raw

    # pandas.DataFrame with statistics on each step and info about step type:
    step_info = data.steps


You can then manipulate your data with the standard ``pandas.DataFrame`` methods
(and ``pandas`` methods in general).

Happy pandas-ing!
