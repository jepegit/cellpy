Configuring cellpy
==================

How the configuration parameters are set and read
-------------------------------------------------

When ``cellpy`` is imported, a default set of parameters is set.
Then it tries to read the parameters
from your .conf-file (located in your user directory). If successful,
the parameters set in your .conf-file will over-ride the default.

The parameters are stored in the module ``cellpy.parameters.prms``.

If you would like to change some of the settings during your script
(or in your ``jupyter notebook``), *e.g.* if you
want to use the ``cycle_mode`` option "cathode" instead of the
default "anode", then import the prms class and set new
values:

.. code-block:: python

    from cellpy import parameters.prms

    # Changing cycle_mode to cathode
    prms.Reader.cycle_mode = 'cathode'

    # Changing delimiter to  ',' (used when saving .csv files)
    prms.Reader.sep = ','

    # Changing the default folder for processed (output) data
    prms.Paths.outdatadir = 'experiment01/processed_data'


The configuration file
----------------------

``cellpy`` tries to read your .conf-file when imported the first time,
and looks in your user directory after
files named ``.cellpy_prms_SOMENAME.conf``.

If you have run ``cellpy setup`` in the cmd window or in the shell, the
configuration file will be placed in the appropriate place.
It will have the name ``.cellpy_prms_USERNAME.conf`` (where USERNAME is your username).

The configuration file is a YAML-file and it is reasonably easy to read and edit (but
remember that YAML is rather strict with regards to spaces and indentations).

As an example, here are the first lines
from one of the authors' configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    Paths:
        outdatadir: C:\scripts\processing_cellpy\out
        rawdatadir: I:\Org\MPT-BAT-LAB\Arbin-data
        cellpydatadir: C:\scripts\processing_cellpy\cellpyfiles
        db_path: C:\scripts\processing_cellpy\db
        filelogdir: C:\scripts\processing_cellpy\logs

The first part contains definitions of the different paths, files and file-patterns
that ``cellpy`` will use. This is the place where you most likely will have to do
some edits sometime.

The next part contains definitions required when using a database:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # settings related to the db used in the batch routine
    Db:
        db_type: simple_excel_reader
        db_table_name: db_table
        db_header_row: 0
        db_unit_row: 1
        db_data_start_row: 2
        db_search_start_row: 2
        db_search_end_row: -1

    # definitions of headers for the simple_excel_reader
    DbCols:
        id:
        - id
        - int
        exists:
        - exists
        - bol
        batch:
        - batch
        - str
        sub_batch_01:
        - b01
        - str
        .
        .


This part is rather long (since it needs to define the column names used in the db excel sheet).

The next part contains settings regarding your dataset and the ``cellreader``, as well as for
the different ``instruments``. At the bottom you will find the settings for the ``batch`` utility.

As you can see, the author of this particular file most likely works with
silicon as anode material for lithium ion
batteries (the ``nom_cap`` is set to 3579 mAh/g, *i.e.* the theoretical
gravimetric lithium capacity for silicon at normal temperatures) and is using windows.

By the way, if you are wondering what
the '.' means... it means nothing - it was just something I added in this
tutorial text to indicate that there is
more stuff in the actual file than what is shown here.
